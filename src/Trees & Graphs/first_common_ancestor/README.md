# First Common Ancestor

Given a binary search tree, find the first common ancestor of two nodes. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. Assume the two node values will be in the tree.

My approach: Since we know the tree is a binary search tree the first common ancestor will be when the value of the given node is inbetween the other two node values.
